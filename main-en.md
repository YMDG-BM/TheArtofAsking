# Main Text:
We have observed that even after posting the article "How To Ask Questions The Smart Way" in the group announcement, few people truly grasp the essence of asking a question worth answering. Here, we provide a formula. We hope you can first try to solve the problem yourself following this method. If you still cannot resolve it, then come and ask according to the requirements.

**Disclaimer: This guide does not provide actual support services for this project!**

## The Formula:
### Step 1:

Observe your error message. Many error messages include a solution. For example, if we encounter this error in Python:

```python
File "<stdin>", line 1
    if True
           ^
SyntaxError: expected ':'
```

This error tells us: Our `if` statement is missing a colon at the end. To fix this, we need to add a colon at the end of this statement.

If your problem is resolved at this step, you can stop here. Congratulations on solving your problem yourself.

### Step 2:

Ask an AI. Current AI is quite advanced. Taking our question to an AI can easily yield the answer we need. However, note: Content generated by AI is for reference only.

Let's assume we encounter the problem from Step 1 again. We can copy the error message, or screenshot it, and ask the AI how to resolve it. Usually, the AI will provide a detailed solution.

### Step 3:

Search the web. The internet is now highly developed, allowing us to easily find answers to various problems. For example, we have the problem: "I want to install Dev-C++".

Here, we obviously don't have an error message, as it's simply our requirement. In this case, we need to find another way and search the vast internet for an answer. (The author recommends using Bing search, as it has significantly fewer ads than Baidu search.)

Searching also has its art. For our current problem, searching for the keywords "Dev-C++ installation package" should suffice.

If your problem is properly resolved here, you can stop. Congratulations on once again solving your problem yourself.

Another note: Due to the nature of the Simplified Chinese internet (or the domestic internet), we might easily click on an ad-filled webpage or download an installer that requires payment. We recommend carefully reading [this article](https://www.criwits.top/missing/software-installation.html) to learn how to bypass these ads and paid content as much as possible.

### Step 4:

Consult the documentation. Many problems occur because you didn't install something properly according to the documentation. However, it's also possible that the author's documentation is simply very, very poor. Let's first exclude the latter and assume the problem occurs with an application that has a good community and well-maintained documentation.

For example, we encounter the problem: The GZ:CTF we installed fails to start, reporting the error:

```shell
bash: docker: command not found
```

At this point, we need to look for a solution in the project's documentation. In the "Quick Start" section, we can easily see that we need to install Docker to use GZ:CTF. Next, we just need to follow the instructions to install Docker, and most likely GZ:CTF will start properly. However, we might encounter other issues, in which case we start the self-resolution process again from Step 1.

### Step 5:

Look for solutions to the problem on various forums and blogs, such as StackOverflow, or the issues section of the relevant GitHub project, etc. Sometimes we encounter very strange problems. For example, the system booted normally the day before, but the next day, the Kali Linux boot option couldn't even be found.

In this situation, we need to extract the key information. Combining with the previous steps, obviously we don't see any error message because there simply isn't one. First, ask the AI: "Why did my Kali boot entry disappear?" The AI will generally tell you: "Bootloader damaged." Next, we can search online using the keywords "Kali Linux boot repair" to find a solution. Generally, for such strange problems, personal blogs and similar places will have more answers.

### Step 6:

If you've reached this point and your problem still persists, and even the mighty AI cannot help you, then please formulate your question according to the following formula.

1.  What software are you using? What operating system?
2.  What is the error message? (Screenshots are recommended.)
3.  What methods have you tried? What resources have you consulted? Describe in detail. Providing pictures and links is even better.
4.  Where did you obtain this software? Provide the download link you used.

By describing your problem in such detail, we might become interested in replying to you.

**Note**: When asking others, maintain respect and politeness. No one owes you anything, nor is anyone indispensable to you. We answer your questions because they are worth answering, not because we are obligated to answer all your questions, change your diapers, and pat your back to comfort you.

However, if you have completed all the steps above and prepared your question according to the formula, we are very willing to help and explore it together. This is precisely the joy of the geek community — challenging and solving various high-quality problems.
